[OpenLayers](http://openlayers.org/) library packed for use in Ruby on Rails asset pipeline. Currently includes OpenLayers version 2.12

## This gem is not being actively maintained

I no longer work on projects involving OpenLayers, so this gem won't receive updates as fast/often as it should. Consider using `rails-assets-openlayers` gem from https://rails-assets.org/

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'openlayers-rails'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install openlayers-rails

## Usage

Add `//= require openlayers-rails` to your `app/assets/javascripts/application.js` manifest file.
